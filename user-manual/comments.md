# Comments

When you read a post at /posts/:id and press the comment button, the page will route to /posts/:id/comments (this route is [nested](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-router-nested-routes/)), and will smoothly auto-scroll to the comments section below the post.

You can edit or delete comments written by you. For example, by pressing the "Edit" icon, you would be able to edit the comment, and you can click the "Cancel" button to render the comment view again:

By clicking the "delete" icon, we will ask you to confirm that you really wish to delete this comment, as deleted comments cannot be recovered \[The same procedure also applies for topics and posts]:&#x20;
