# Forum Topics

When you visit the **/forumtopics** page, you would be able to view the topics of this web forum, a brief description written by the community leaders, the username of the creator, the date of creation, and the number of posts under the topic. We use topics to tag posts so that they can be filtered more easily. Therefore, you can search for posts under multiple topics by subscribing to these topics, and also use them to customize your feed!

If you are an admin ("community leader"), you would be able to create, update and delete topics so that the collection of topics remains relevant.&#x20;
