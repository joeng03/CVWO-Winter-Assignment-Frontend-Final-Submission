#### Layout

After you log in, the home page looks like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Notice that for wider screens, "Search by", "Sort by" and "Dark mode" hints would be rendered as there are more available spaces</p></figcaption></figure>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

With wider screens (>=600px), we choose a landscape view for the cards, and for narrower screens (<600px), we choose a portrait view for the cards.
